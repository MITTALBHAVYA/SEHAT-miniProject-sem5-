# SEHAT: Predictive Health Application

Welcome to SEHAT, an interactive Predictive Health Application designed to forecast the likelihood of diabetes and heart disease. Utilizing Streamlit and pre-trained machine learning models, this application provides real-time predictions to empower users with valuable health insights.

## Project Overview

SEHAT is a user-friendly web application that offers predictive insights into two major health concerns:

1. **Diabetes Prediction**
2. **Heart Disease Prediction**

Each section allows users to input specific health parameters, which are then processed by pre-trained machine learning models to provide immediate predictions.

## Repository Link

You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/MITTALBHAVYA/SEHAT-miniProject-sem5-).

## Application Sections

### 1. Diabetes Prediction

Users can input the following health parameters:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

The application uses a pre-loaded diabetes prediction model to process these inputs and generate a prediction on the potential presence or absence of diabetes.

### 2. Heart Disease Prediction

Users can input the following medical attributes:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression induced by exercise
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia condition

The application uses a pre-trained heart disease prediction model to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on the provided details.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Immediate insights into potential health conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface accommodating users from diverse backgrounds.
- **Interactive Input Forms**: Seamlessly input health parameters and trigger predictions with intuitive buttons.
- **Educational Insights**: Understand the correlation between health metrics and the likelihood of developing diabetes or heart disease.

## Project Goals

### 1. Accessibility and User-Friendly Interface

Create an intuitive and easy-to-use interface accessible to individuals from diverse backgrounds and varying levels of technical proficiency.

### 2. Health Risk Assessment

Facilitate rapid health risk assessments through predictive models, assisting users in understanding their risk factors and encouraging them to seek professional medical advice.

### 3. Encouraging Proactive Healthcare Measures

Foster a proactive approach to healthcare by promoting early awareness and intervention. Encourage users to take informed steps towards managing their health.

### 4. Education and Health Literacy

Enhance users' understanding of how their health metrics correlate with the risk of developing diabetes or heart disease, fostering a greater sense of personal responsibility for health maintenance.

### 5. Ethical and Informed Use of Predictive Technology

Emphasize the ethical and responsible use of predictive technology. Interpret predictive outcomes as indicators rather than conclusive diagnoses, highlighting the necessity of consulting healthcare professionals.
